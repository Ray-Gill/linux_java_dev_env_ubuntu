# Changing Linux Distribution
Currently the provisining supports Ubuntu.

If you need another Linux Distro then look for: ## OS SPECIFIC: change this for different distro  
There are 6 places forsure that would need refactoring:  
* OS (Vagrantfile: config.vm.box)
* ansible (provision.sh)
* unzip (startup role)
* chrome (chrome role)
* git (git role)
* gui (Gnome: gui role)
